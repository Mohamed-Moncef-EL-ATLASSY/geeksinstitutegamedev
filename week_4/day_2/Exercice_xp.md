# Video Game Studies: Core Concepts Assignment

## Section 1: History and Chronology (3 Points)

### Question 1: The Crash and The Revival (10 Points)
Describe the circumstances that led to the 1983 Video Game Crash. Identify the single company and console that is credited with reviving the entire home console industry shortly thereafter, and name the famous mascot introduced during this revival era.

Answer:
- Too many low-quality games/consoles and weak QA killed trust; home computers pulled players away.
- Revival: Nintendo, NES (Famicom), strict licensing/QA.
- Mascot: Mario.

### Question 2: Era Differentiation (10 Points)
Contrast the Golden Age of Arcades (1970–1983) with the Modern 3D & Online Era (2000–2010). Name one key game from each era and explain the fundamental difference in the player's primary social setting (e.g., public vs. private).

Answer:
- Golden Age: Arcades, public/co-located; key game: Pac-Man.
- Modern 3D & Online: Home + online; key game: World of Warcraft (or Halo 3).
- Social shift: public arcades → private/online.

### Question 3: The 16-bit Wars (10 Points)
Identify the two main companies and their respective consoles that dominated the 16-bit Era (1990–1999) console wars. Name two PC games from this same decade that were pivotal in establishing a non-console-specific genre.

Answer:
- Console rivals: Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) vs Super Nintendo (SNES).
- PC standouts: Doom (FPS) and StarCraft (RTS) (also Warcraft II/Quake/Ultima Online/Diablo).

## Section 2: Genre Classification & Evolution (4 Points)

### Question 4: Genre Definition and Examples
Define the following three core genres. For each genre, provide one specific game example that perfectly fits its classification:

Answer:
- Metroidvania: Ability-gated 2D exploration/action; example: Super Metroid.
- JRPG: Party, authored story, turn/ATB combat; example: Final Fantasy VI.
- RTS: Base-building, gather, simultaneous orders; example: StarCraft.

### Question 5: Understanding Hybridization
Explain the evolutionary path from the original Rogue genre to the modern Roguelite genre. How does a "Roguelite" game (like Hades) differ from a traditional "Roguelike" (like Nethack) in terms of player progression or penalty for death?

Answer:
- Roguelike (Rogue/Nethack): Procedural runs, permadeath, full reset.
- Roguelite (Hades/Dead Cells): Procedural runs plus persistent unlocks/softer death penalties.

### Question 6: The Souls-like Subgenre
The Souls-like subgenre is a hybrid of Action and RPG elements. Which specific historical title (from Part E) is credited with defining this subgenre, and what two core design elements (e.g., combat difficulty, world design) must a game possess to be classified as "Souls-like"?

Answer:
- Defining title: Demon's Souls.
- Must have: (1) Deliberate, punishing melee with stamina and costly death/retrieval. (2) Interconnected world with sparse checkpoints/shortcuts.

## Section 3: Influence and Key Titles (3 Points)

### Question 7: Technology as a Driver
Explain how the shift to 3D graphics (Hardware Evolution) directly enabled the existence and popularity of the Open-World genre. Name the key historical title (from Part E) that solidified this transition.

Answer:
- 3D hardware gave free camera/streaming, making big seamless worlds work.
- Key title: Grand Theft Auto III.

### Question 8: Community and Modding
Describe the process by which a game's modding community can lead to the creation of an entirely new genre. Use the example of the MOBA genre, detailing which core strategy game it evolved from.

Answer:
- Mod tools + community iteration can birth new genres.
- MOBA came from Warcraft III custom maps (Defense of the Ancients) → Dota 2/League of Legends.

### Question 9: The Pillars of Gaming
Choose two games from the Key Historical Titles (Part E) list that you believe had the largest contrasting influence on the industry (e.g., one focusing on skill, the other on narrative or scale). Name the two games and explain their differing monumental contributions to game design.

Answer:
- Counter-Strike: Skill-first, round/team FPS with economy pacing and esports shape.
- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time: 3D adventure benchmark with lock-on, cinematic staging, spatial puzzles.
- Contrast: skill/esports focus vs narrative/cinematic adventure.
