# Daily Gaming Challenge

## Level 1: Quick Recall (5-10 Minutes)
Challenge: Genre Spotlight & Historical Snapshot

Your Turn:
- Game: The Legend of Zelda (1986) → Action-Adventure.
- Event: Rise of LAN Parties → 1990s (16-bit Era & PC rise).

## Level 2: Analytical Byte (10-15 Minutes)
Challenge: The Evolution Investigator

Option B:
- Permadeath + procedural generation break classic linear progression: each death resets the run but fresh layouts keep variety; Roguelites soften this with meta-progression so players still advance between runs.

## Level 3: Design & Influence Deep Dive (15-20 Minutes)
Challenge: The Game Designer’s Dilemma

- Tech advancement: 3D hardware + streaming, enabled GTA III’s open world and World of Warcraft’s fully 3D world.
- Community trend: World of Warcraft leaned on rising online guild/raid culture and persistent chat/social hubs.
- New game idea: An open-world online action-RPG where city crime sandbox meets shared social hubs—core genre: open-world action RPG. New experience: freeform city exploration with GTA-style missions, but persistent factions/guilds, shared economies, and co-op heists/raids blending PvE and light PvP.
