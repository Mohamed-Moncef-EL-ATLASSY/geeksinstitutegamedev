## Exercice : About the Game Design
Goal/Rules/Core Loop (3 lines):
- Goal: Deliver parcels across sky islands.
- Rules: Fuel is limited; hitting terrain drops cargo.
- Core Loop: Plan jump → Boost between pads → Deliver → Refuel/upgrade → Repeat harder routes.

Feedback (key action):
- Drop-off glow and soft chime when you land on the pad.

SCAMPER on favorite game (Hades):
- Substitute: arenas → open sky routes.
- Combine: dash + cast → air-dodge tag.
- Adapt: heat levels → wind tiers (lift/drag).
- Modify: shorter fights; add altitude puzzles.
- Put to another use: boons → delivery contracts.
- Eliminate: walls; focus on traversal.
- Reverse: climb up layers instead of descending.

## Exercice: About the Game
Idea (Player → Verb → Goal): Player → Jetpack-glide → Deliver fragile parcels across sky isles.

Goal/Rules/Feedback:
- Goal: Deliver all parcels without cracks.
- Rule 1: Fuel only recharges at pads.
- Rule 2: Hard hits crack parcels and cut payout.
- Feedback: Crack sound and vignette when integrity drops.

Rule change + prediction:
- Change: Fuel slowly regenerates mid-air.
- Effect: More forgiving; focus shifts to landing accuracy and wind timing.

---

## Exercice : Pillars
- Flow (keep moving)
- Precision (clean landings)
- Calm risk (relaxed vibe, real stakes)

Non-goal: No grind or wait timers.

## Exercice: MDA
- Mechanic: Boost with heat → Feeling: Tension.
- Mechanic: Magnetic pads → Feeling: Relief.
- Mechanic: Shifting crosswinds → Feeling: Alert.

Remove one: Without crosswinds, routes feel flat and less tense.

---

## Exercice: Core Loop & Progression
Core Loop: Do plan route → Get payout/fuel → Unlock upgrades → Repeat harder routes.

Progression (Teach/Test/Twist/Master) for Wind Riding:
- Teach: Straight path, gentle crosswind, drift arrow.
- Test: Gaps plus short boosts vs wind.
- Twist: Gusts pulse; time boosts.
- Master: Vertical drafts and mid-air pad stops.

---

## Exercice: Goals, Rules, Feedback, Rewards
- Goal: Finish a three-parcel chain with no cracks.
- Rule 1: Boost overheats if held; cool on pads.
- Rule 2: High-speed hits lower integrity.
- Feedback (success): Pad glows cyan + payout popup.
- Feedback (failure): Fracture icon + thud SFX + short rumble.
- Cosmetic reward: New contrail color after 5 flawless chains.

---

## Exercice: Fair Challenge & Balance
- Fairness tool: Coyote time on pad edges to forgive late landings.
- Tuning knobs:
	- Wind strength: Softer early gusts to cut early spills.
	- Fuel drain: Lower early so novices can experiment.

---

## Exercice : Level Design (Teach → Test → Twist → Master)
- Room 1 (Teach): Short hop, stable wind; checkpoint at start.
- Room 2 (Test): Three pads, mild wind; checkpoint after pad 2.
- Room 3 (Twist): Vertical draft + moving pad; checkpoint before draft.
- Room 4 (Master): Branching route, shifting gusts; checkpoint mid-route.

---

## Exercice: UX & Accessibility
- Accessibility features:
	- High-contrast parcel integrity toggle (Settings → Accessibility).
	- Light auto-snap to pads (Settings → Controls).
- Prompt: “Hold jump to charge boost; steer into the pad glow—release early if heat meter nears red.”
